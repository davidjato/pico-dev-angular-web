With people. With attention.</p>",

      "VISION": "<p>We envision a culture where celebration creates impact.</p><p>Where events are not defined by their size, but by what they trigger.</p><p>Where music creates consciousness, community creates cohesion, and purpose becomes part of nightlife.</p><p>Our vision is to develop Picollect as a platform that connects artists, communities and mental health, in Luxembourg and beyond.</p>",
      "MANIFIESTO": "<p>We believe that celebration is a responsibility.<br>We believe that music is a universal language.</p><p>We believe that mental health deserves care, access and visibility, and that joy and consciousness can coexist.</p><p>Picollect is not just something you participate in.<br>It's something you stand for.</p>"
