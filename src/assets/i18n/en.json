      "MANIFIESTO": "<p>We believe that celebration is a responsibility.<br>We believe that music is a universal language.</p><p>We believe that mental health deserves care, access and visibility, and that joy and consciousness can coexist.</p><p>Picollect is not just something you participate in.<br>It's something you stand for.</p>"
